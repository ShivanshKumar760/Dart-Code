/*
Sets in Dart is a special case in List where all the inputs are unique 
i.e it doesnâ€™t contain any repeated input. It can also be interpreted as 
an unordered array with unique inputs. The set comes in play when we want to 
store unique values in a single variable without considering the order of the inputs. 
The sets are declared by the use of a set keyword.

var variable_name = <variable_type>{};
 
or,
 
Set <variable_type> variable_name = {};*/

void main() {
  var set1 = {
    "Yo",
    "Whats",
    "Up",
    "Yo"
  }; //the second Yo will not get printed as set contains
  //unique value
  print(set1);
  //Set can also contain different data type
  var set2 = {1, "hello", 2.2};
  print(set2);
  //Set keyword

  Set<int> number = {1, 2, 3, 4};
  print(number);

  //defining a empty set
  var emptySet = {};
  print(emptySet.runtimeType); //will return a _Map<dynamic, dynamic>
  //but we have declared it as a set so return type should be _Set

  //TO avoid that we can declare a empty set like this
  Set emptySet1 = {};
  //or
  //var emptySet2 = <data_type>{};
  var emptySet2 = <int>{};
  print(emptySet1.runtimeType);
  print(emptySet2.runtimeType);
}
